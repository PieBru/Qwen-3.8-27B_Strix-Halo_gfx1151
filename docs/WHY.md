# Why this exists — cloud-free intelligence on a desk

> From [Qwen3.8-27B on Strix Halo](../README.md) — the full pitch, with the
> numbers, the power math, and the philosophy.

If you are a solo developer with an AI agent working around the clock, a
privacy-sensitive operator, or any other entity that wants to be free from
cloud chains — read on. An all-purpose computer that cost **less than €2,000**
(launch offer) now serves a 27-billion-parameter reasoning model, entirely
from your own desk. Which machine? We tested on a **GMKtec EVO-X2** (Ryzen
AI MAX+ 395, 128 GiB) — [amazon.it/dp/B0F6X332N6](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B0F6X332N6/) —
any mini-PC or desktop with the same AMD Strix Halo APU works the same. **Not
affiliated**: no sponsorship, no free hardware, no affiliate links (the
shopping link above is a plain product URL, no referral tag); we paid for
ours. External links in this README point only to the open-source projects,
model publishers, hardware references, and community threads this work builds
on or measures — see
[Acknowledgements](../README.md#-thanks-to-the-authors-of-this-software-stack) — never to
sponsored placements.

- **No API keys, no quotas, no meters.** The model lives in your RAM
  (~122 GiB of it, mlock'd — the box's whole personality is inference).
- **Real speeds, measured**: 16–21 tokens/s typical sustained decode with
  DFlash2 speculative decoding (content-dependent: acceptance spans
  0.28–0.91, so the same model spans ~15–35 t/s; peaks near the top on
  narrative-style output), ~330 t/s prefill; a five-recipe menu (quality /
  balanced / speed / vision / a context dial to a 256k-token window) you
  switch per request, like a reasoning level.
- **Sips power**: ~85 W sustained at full tilt — order of magnitude under a
  multi-GPU rig; idle cost roughly a lightbulb (~€0.04/night at €0.12/kWh,
  computed from the 85 W figure — verify against your tariff).
- **Private by physics**: prompts never leave the machine. No telemetry to
  disable, no retention policy to trust — unplugged is unambiguous.
- **Yours**: no deprecations, no price changes, no terms-of-service updates
  that quietly reshape your workflow. The stack is open source end to end.

The recipes, the numbers, and every trap we hit (there were many) are
documented in this repo — so your agent can run 24/7 on hardware you own
outright.

## How we know (the method behind every number)

All benchmarks are back-to-back interleaved pairs (lesson #1); every battery's
raw evidence is committed under `results/` — CSVs, server logs, kernel
journal excerpts; experiments run under pre-registered decision rules (see
[PLAN-INDEX](PLAN-INDEX.md); the reasoning plan has landed and is archived
locally) and the reasoning batteries' answer keys are computed by the graders
themselves; claims carry OBSERVED / INFERRED / REPORTED labels; and when our
own adversarial README audit caught numbers without committed evidence, we
corrected the README rather than the evidence (2026-08-23). If a number in
this repo can't be re-run from it, it doesn't belong here.
